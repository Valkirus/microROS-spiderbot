MicroROS Pico-SDK project based from the example of [Video-Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dGCcT9rxso&list=PLspDyukWAtRU6CExohVFg07T98ssxdqy1), made for a servo2040 to control 18 servos from a hexapod running ROS2.

Not used. [Eddie's servo driver](https://github.com/EddieCarrera/chica-servo2040-simpleDriver/tree/master) is way better and faster.
